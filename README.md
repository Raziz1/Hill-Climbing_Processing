## Other Notes 📝
* The terrain is generated using a Box2D chainshape and perlin noise. It isn't truly infinite because I didn't implement the dynamic construction of the chainshape
* The car is attached to the wheels using a wheel joint (Made of a revolute joint, and distance joint)
* Was converted to an Android Project and can run on an android device (Not Included)
* Contains an exported application file
